  		<h1> Introduction </h1>

    	<p>  
    	I am an entrepreneur who loves to gamble on good ideas, learn something new everyday, and collaborate with brilliant people.
 
    	I recently sold my half of a small production company to pursue learning how to program. I love soccer, music, travelling abroad, and almost every series on Showtime and HBO!

  		<h1> More About Me </h1>
  		<h2 class="title"> What are your favorite hobbies? </h2>
  
  
   		 <p> Playing soccer, playing the guitar, cooking, reading, political discourse, travelling abroad, the beach and hanging out with good friends. </p>
  


  		<h2 class="title"> What’s your dream job? </h2>
  
    	 <p> A professional soccer player, but it is a little to late for that! So my second choice would be to start a company that helps solve a major problem that is environmentally friendly, makes a positive impact in the community and is also profitable. </p>


  
  
  
  		<h2 class="title"> What’s your background? </h2>

  
    	<p> I have been an entrepreneur since I was a kid. I created my own website at around age 12 with the help from the book “XML for Dummies” : ) to sell wholesale sunglasses online. Unfortunately, I was not so successful, but I learned a lot. <br>
    	<br>
      	I studied International Business at Florida State University for two years abroad (Spain & Panama) before transferring to a Cal State school where I ended up getting a degree in integrated studies with a concentration in Business & Film. </p>
  

  
  		<h2 class="title"> What music have you been listening to lately? </h2>
 
  
    	<p>Jack Johnson, Milky Chance, Robert Johnson, Third Eye Blind, Kenny Chesney, The Rolling Stones, Vance Joy, Jack White, Panama, George Strait, The Might Mighty Bosstones, and Manu Chao. </p>
